# E-Annapurna
## Introduction
The <b>E Annapurna</b> is a volunteer based organization that works to get surplus food from restaurants to the less fortunate sections of society in cities across India. The organization functions on and propagates the basic ideology of self-sustained communities across the city i.e. each locality/community within the city will contribute towards providing food to the needy through its local volunteers and restaurants. The traditional the food distributed to the needy is sourced from restaurants, which regularly provide surplus or freshly cooked food on a goodwill basis. Our System provides both Website and Admin Panel for the E Annapurna. The Websites showcase the work of the organization to attract volunteers, Sponsors and donors. Also we get the information of those who are in need of food through the website. The second part of the system is Admin Panel. It is used to Manage and analyze the NGO. It provides in-depth report with graphs donations, volunteers, sponsors and requests of food. It enables the NGO Admin to allocate volunteers to the specific consumer and analyze their report.
